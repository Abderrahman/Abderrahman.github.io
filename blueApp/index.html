## Lynda com - Foundations of Programming ~ Design Patterns
	This lynda course offers a look inside the 7 most used design patterns, starting with "Strategy" using a duck example to illustrate this design pattern.
	- In Strategy, it\`s better to favor composition over inheritage (which is one the design principles) in order to have control over each duck behavior (ex: fly behavior & quack behavior).
	- In Obsever, we see a solution that has been designed for a specific problem: When having an Observable (WeatherData) who needs to notify its observers (Forecast, Statistics ..)  with the last updates.
	- In Decorator, we used the coffee expl, milk, mocha, soy... And we saw that this same DP is used in the InputStream and BufferedInputStream buf = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("a.txt"));
	- In Singleton, to solve the "two threads accessing the getInstance at the same time" add the "synchronized" keyword in the function declaration. "public synchronized void getInstance".
	- The State design pattern look almost the same as Strategy DP in the class diagram, but it\`s used for a different purposes. This example was illustrated using the Gumball Machine.
	- And finally, the Iterator DP used with Collections. It\`s principle is that we don\`t need to know an object content, we only need a method to iterate over it\`s elements. (+ Factory the last DP)

	
# Project Management

## Lynda.com - Insights from a Project Manager with Bob Mcgannon

	- Most important skills are communication skills, relationship or soft skills whatever you wanna call it and risk management, the risk of miscommunication, the risk of hiring the wrong people ...
	- What is your advice for new Project Managers? Talk to other people, try to obtain their lessons learned and don\`t be afraid to say I could use some help with ...
	- PMBOK is sort of a generic description of what it takes to take a project from I have an idea to creating a business value and everything in between. What you should know for the exam is generic scenarios.
	- A project has a beginning and an end. Once the product is created you stop the project. It begins with an idea and stops with the first version of a product. Business is the ongoing manufacture of the product...
	- Blind Spots for PMs? The vast majority of projects are business projects not technology projects. It\`s about those people who gonna use the product and giving them a new capability. not the technologie. 
	- Process of PMP certifications involves documenting a significant number of hours that you have dedicated to project management in each of the various state of a project: initiating, planning ... and then you apply for the exam and you sit for the exam which is 200 questions Multiple choice 4 hours scenario based questions.
	- Why did u take the certif? PMP gives you credibility working with ppl from other countries and helps you conduct dialogues with project managers from other businesses because we speak the same vocabulary.
	- Why does projects fail? Lack of communication with people who are going to use the tool you\`re building. And the arguments that have not happened yet with stakeholders or sponsors: like say you\`re making decisions on a project yourself and one of your major stakeholders says stop "you\`re doing the wrong thing", That wrong thing should have been identified a long time ago.
	- Intelligent Disobedience (comes from the world of guide dogs: The dog should understand the objective of his master and where he wanna go and then disobey those commands in certain circumstances for the benefit of both of them). So Intelligent Disobedience is the ability to look at the situation and the rules.. look at the standard way of doing things and vary them for the benefit of the business and the project. with communication on the fly. You could say to your stakeholders and sponsors: Hey, I see this situation, I recommend we do this, I\`d like your autorisation to do so.
	- Triple threat leader: Business Analysis (requirement), Change management (costumers got to get used to that new system)... 
	A triple threat leader can manage or directly influence "understanding the business process, changing those business processes, translating that to project requirement gathering, then manage the product and put tools and capabilities in place and finally take that new capability and turn it into business value".
	- Advice about conflict resolution: vary from instance to instance (country culture, company culture). Advice: put your truths on the table (every person has a set of experiences, a set of motives, a set of expectations their manager puts on them) and invite the person you\`re working with to do the same thing, and the outcome that comes about (take place) as a result to that, are as rich as they can possibly be.
	- Difference between Agile and Waterfall project management? A lot of differences, but there are 2 basic differences: 
		1) the idea of agile is to get things installed faster, they wanna get some sort of benefits faster. In Waterfall I\`m going through my requirements, my design, build... and then in the end install all in one go. 
		2) The management of it: in Agile, the scope may vary but the time and cost don\`t. In waterfall, scope is sacred and you then work out the time and cost.
	- How to prevent Scope Creep? (Customer adds more tasks) 1) Train every member of your project team on the concept of scope creep: what it is? and how to control it. 2) Send out limits for your project.
	- Ever said no to managing a project? 
	- How do I advance in my career as a project manager? Do project management well. Ask your Senior Manager about his job and how he got there.
	- Future trends in PM? The variety of communication tools: video conference, facebook, sharepoint... and taking advantage of the capabilities it give us as a project management community.

## Lynda.com - Project Management Simplified

	An Overview of the Process:
	I) Defining
		1) Define the project:
		- Time, Cost, Quality: Define the key driver between those three. Example: The olympics (Time is the key driver), Nuclear power station (it\`s quality because if we have to wait for another year that\`s fine)
		- Meeting: 1st kickoff meeting: Find out what they want (stakeholders... ), after one week 2nd kickoff meeting: Get an agreement for the plan you came up with.
		- Get the project definition in writing: If you have a verbal agreement, customers will add more to your project (scope creep), or will disagree on deliverables (they will say: that\`s not what we wanted).
	II) Planning
		2) List the tasks: Right-Brain Method: Brainstorm with the team. Left-Brain Method: WBS Structured Breakdown of the work. Third Method: Ask experts, ask a consultant, search on google...
		3) Estimate times and costs for each task: Imagine you\`re driving a car to your home. Your best amount of time to do that is 20 min, your average time is 30 min and your worst is 60 min. What you wanna do is go halfway between the average and the worst, meaning say to your client something like: 45 min, 42 min or 48 min.
		4) Add up time and cost: Think about the running order of the tasks. Draw a PERT chart. Make sure the critical tasks are accurately estimated. Start with PERT first and then it will be easier for Gantt chart.
		5) Shorthen your project plan: a- Spend more (add more people, more ressources), b- Reduce the quality (if the key driver is time), c- Overlap tasks (example: you only need 1 completed floor of the building for a task, meaning you can do this task while you\`re still constructing the building. Or could I open while installing furniture? Yes, as long as the front desk looks good. [Money up, quality down, overlapping]
		6) Draw a Gantt Chart: The Benefits: a- Communication: there\`s no better way to show plan to other people. b- Forecast resource requirement (when are the busy periods). c- Brilliant for monitoring progress.
		7) Calculate resource requirements over time: Adjust using the float of noncritical tasks.
		8) Assess risks and prepare action plans: Plan for reducing risks: *Less likely to happen* or *Less serious*. For example there\`s like weather problems, that you can\`t make less likely but you can make it less serious so you can make your wedding have a kind of rooftop. Or for example: falling over a cliff: you can make it less likely to happen by not going near the edge of the cliff.
	III) Controlling
		9) Monitor progress: The 1st question I\`d ask if I was managing a project manager is: Can I have a look at your gantt chart? Because a colored in Gantt chart (the line) is the only way to control your progress.
		10) Monitor cost: Budget vs Progress. Sometimes spend is nonlinear (it\`s possible that in the first task we\`re buying all the equipements for the project and we\`re actually good on the budget).
		11) Reschedule: If project is running late: money up, quality down, overlap or let project slip but whatever you do do not be tempting to do nothing and hope.
	IV) Reviewing
		12) Review: learn and praise: Whatever you do, don\`t avoid doing a review, it\`s absolutely vital, ask those 3 questions: 
		- What was good about the project? Things that were good could be repeated in future projects.
		- What was bad about the project? Think about what were the problems, so that we can make sure we don\`t fall for those same problems when we have future project that are similar.
		- What could we have don\`t better?

## Lynda.com - Foundations of Programming - Test-Driven Development	
	1 - Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD)
		TDD isn\`t about Stress testing (number of users using the app before crashing), performance testing, beta testing, integration testing or acceptance testing, it\`s about using automated unit tests.
		TDD "does development backwards" by writing detailed test cases first to validate the story\`s requirements are satisfied, and then writing the code focused on ensuring each test case passes.
		TDD is for a day to day, minute to minute programming... if you\`re programming you need to write your own unit tests, you can\`t use your testers for this kind of situation.
		TDD is an Agile development technique, just as Pair Programming, Refactoring and Continuous Integration.
	2 - Getting Started
		- Unit Testing Frameworks: JUnit (Java), NUnit (.NET), PyUnit (Python), CppUnit (C++). All of these are based on xUnit.
		TestNG is a testing framework for Java inspired by JUnit and NUnit. It\`s design goal is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.
		- To assert: is to state something to be true. It\`s not asking questions, not inviting an opinion, it\`s simply stating something to be true.
		Example: 1) To assert something positively: "I assert there\`s only 30 days in april". 2) Or to assert something isn\`t true: I assert the book x wasn\`t written by the author y.
		- JUnit is a part of the java library. You can run assert commands anywhere in your code. For example the command [void assertSame(obj1, obj2)] asserts that obj1 & obj2 are references to the same object.
	3 - Working with Tests
		TDD Process: Red/Green/Refactor - repeat. Annotations: in java: @Test, in DOT NET: [TestMethod] and [TestClass]
		The benefit of having these unit tests is to easily see the impact from refactoring that you weren\`t immediatly visioning. So just having these tests and being able to run them all the time is very useful.
		Naming: - For the unit test class we take the name of the class we\`re testing + the word "Test". Example: UserTest, BankAccountTest... and sometimes "UserTestCase" or "UserTests". 
		- For Functions: "test" + the name of the function. Example: testWithDraw (some languages require \`test\`).
	4 - Individual Techniques
		- Testing expected exceptions: we add this extra code: @Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class) that tells JUnit if any code in this test method throws this specific exception we will go green bar.
		- Setting up and tearing down: @Before public void setUp() method is called before each test and @After public void tearDown() method is called after each test. So JUnit will call setUp before every single test method and tearDown after every single method. Reminder: your test methods should be completely independent of each other. @BeforeClass void setUpBeforeClass() (self-explanatory).
		- Common Questions: Do I test private methods? Generally, no. Typically, just make a test for a public method that proves the private method works.
		- Unit tests are not intended to test The Application - only the individual units of code, in isolation.
	5 - Additional Topics
		Typical reasons for *Mock Objects*:
		- Real object hasn\`t been written yet
		- External resource: file system, databases, network, printer
		optional: mock object can be told to expect a certain value. mockObj.expectZip(85645);
		Fake objects (dummy objects) are the simplest kind of mock objects they return pre-arranged results.
		Mock Object Framework: JMock, easyMock, mockito (Java).
		*Code Coverage* is typical for Enterprise Heavy Environment such as Java & .NET. Examples of code coverage tools: Emma, Clover by Attlasian (Java), dotCover and NCover (.NET)
	6 - Conclusion
		Behavior Driven Development: RSpec (Ruby) - Cucumber (Java).

## Lynda - Fundamentals of Software Version Control
	01. Overview of Software Version Control
		How do teams benefit from version control?
			- synchronization -- easy to keep team members always up-to-date
			- accountability -- know who made each change and why
			- conflict detection -- keep the build clean every time
		Label significant changes: labels/tags
		-----------------------------------------
		Check-in = commit (cp changes from working set to repo)
		|----------------------------------------
		|	Check-in 2 lines version:
		|		git add program.c
		|		git commit -m "Add Func1()"
		|	or 1 line version:
		|		git commit -am "Add Func1()"
		|----------------------------------------
		Check-out = update (cp changes from repository to working set)
		|----------------------------------------
		|	git checkout (HEAD) myprog.c (cp changes from repository to working set) - HEAD means rollback to most recent commit and it\`s optional
		|	git checkout 87b53 myprog.c - means rollback to a typical revision/commit
		|----------------------------------------
		Others
		|----------------------------------------
		|	git log -p
		|	git log --oneline --all
		|----------------------------------------
		|	git diff
		|	git diff x y
		|	git diff HEAD (diff between repo and working set) if we commit the working set, then the working set becomes repo
		|----------------------------------------
		Revert/Rollback = overwrite files in your working set with specific version
		|----------------------------------------
		| git revert ... ?
		|----------------------------------------
	02. Background of Software Version Control
		- Centralized: CVS (1986), Perforce (1995), Subversion (2000), Microsoft Team Foundation Server (2010). In centralized version control we only have [Remote Repo (check-in, check-out) <-- working set]
		- Ditributed: Git (2005), Mercuarial (2005). In distributed version control we have [Remote Repo (push, pull) <-- Local repo (add, revert) <-- working set]
		Ditributed repository only:
			- push/export - send changes from one repo to another
			- pull/ import - update your working set with updates
		- branch/fork - make a clone of a repo
		- merge - integrate your branch (clone) back into the original repo
		- reverse integration/forward integration: branching by features
	03. Version Control Concepts
		Workflow integration: check-in -> build (unit test is Green = Build cleanly) -> commit to repository
		The foor different ways that you can use to interact with your version control software: 1) Command lines, 2) Standalone GUI Tools (github), 3) IDE Integration
		and 4) Shell Intergration: allows you to add Context menu to the windows explorer. Example: TortoiseGit, TortoiseSvn, TortoiseHg..
		Branch # Merge, Create Branch:
		|----------------------------------------
		| git branch not-master
		| git branch (to display the current branch)
		| git checkout not-master (change branch to not-master)
		| git merge not-master
		|----------------------------------------
		Tagging, Create Tag, show:
		|----------------------------------------
		| git tag -a v1 -m "Label Version 1"
		| git tag (to display the current tag)
		| git show v1 (to see the specific changes in this tag)
		| git checkout v1
		|----------------------------------------
	04. Subversion
		SVN can be used with microsoft\`s CodePlex which is free for hosting open source projects
	05. Perforce
	06. Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)
	07. Git (The most important in my case)
	08. Mercurial
		cmd> hg --version
		most command are similar to gits
